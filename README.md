This is just a very basic IP Geolocator made in C#.
You can enter any IP Address and it will show the following:
1. Country
2. City
3. Coordinates
4. Region
5. ISP
6. Google Maps link

Here are a few screenshots of it working.

The location on Google Maps is extremely innacurate, but it usually shows the general location of where the IP address is.
